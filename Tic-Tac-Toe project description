# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C

A simple yet feature-rich **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built in C, where the player competes against the computer. The game includes **difficulty levels**, **score tracking**, and a smart computer AI that can block, win, and even play strategically.

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ **1. Two Difficulty Levels**
- **Medium:** Basic AI that makes straightforward moves.
- **Hard (Impossible Mode):** Intelligent AI that:
  - Tries to win immediately  
  - Blocks player winning moves  
  - Prioritizes center  
  - Plays corners strategically  
  - Falls back to first available move  
This makes it nearly impossible for the player to win.

### ✅ **2. Smart Computer AI**
The computer’s decision system includes:
1. Looking for immediate winning moves  
2. Preventing player wins  
3. Playing optimal center and corner positions  
4. Using fallback moves when no strategic moves are available  

---

### ✅ **3. Random Starter**
Each game randomly chooses whether the **player (X)** or **computer (O)** will start—making gameplay more dynamic.

---

### ✅ **4. Score Tracking**
The game maintains scores across multiple rounds:
- **Player Wins**
- **Computer Wins**
- **Draws**

Scores persist until the program exits.

---

### ✅ **5. Clean Console UI**
- Clear board rendering  
- “cls/clear” for smooth refreshing  
- Indicates turns, results, and score

---

### ✅ **6. Input Validation**
Ensures the player enters:
- Valid row/column numbers (1–3)
- A valid difficulty level  
- A valid choice to restart the game

## 🧠 How the AI Works (Simplified)

The computer follows this exact decision logic:

1. **Try to win**  
   Place 'O' somewhere that immediately makes the computer win.

2. **Try to block**  
   If the player can win next turn, block them.

3. **Hard Mode Extra Logic:**  
   - If the center is empty → take it  
   - Else take any available corner  

4. **Else**  
   Take the first available empty cell.

This logic makes the “Hard Mode” feel very challenging.
