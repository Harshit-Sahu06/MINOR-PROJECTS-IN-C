# MINOR-PROJECTS-IN-C
I have created some good projects in c language. They are in this repository.
There are four projects in this repository.
1. A Number_Guessing_Game.
2. A Simple but menu-driven calculator.
3. A Digital Clock which uses the time function to print date and time on the console.
4. A Tic-Tac-Toe game which is hard-coded and covers all the test cases and has two levels of difficulties: both the levels are hard coded.
